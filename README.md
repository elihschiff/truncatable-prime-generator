# truncatable-prime-generator

This project generates the list of all truncatable primes 
> In number theory, a left-truncatable prime is a prime number which, in a given base, contains no 0, and if the leading ("left") digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime. For example, 9137, since 9137, 137, 37 and 7 are all prime.

This project was inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azL5ehbw_24) all about truncatable primes


This project was serves no real purpose as the list of all truncatable primes is finite(83) and known as ween on the Wikipedia article. I made this project for fun in JavaScript so that anyone can run the program directly from their web brower
